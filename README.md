Control Seven-Segment Displays with Pymata4

This program demonstrates how to use the Pymata4 library to control seven-segment displays connected to an Arduino board. It features the initialization of digital pins as outputs, displaying numbers and letters, and scrolling text.

Key Features:
- Initialization of digital pins for seven-segment display control.
- Mapping of numbers and letters to their corresponding seven-segment display representation.
- Function to display numbers or characters on a seven-segment display for a specified duration.
- Function to scroll a text across the seven-segment displays.

How to Use:
1. Ensure the Pymata4 library is installed and your Arduino board is connected.
2. Adjust the pin assignments as necessary for your hardware setup.
3. Run the script to start the display. Modify the 'scrolling_display' function call to change the scrolling text.
